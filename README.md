# ReGREP
A project (that'll take a long time to be done) about recreating the grep utility created by Ken Thompson.


# What is GREP?
GREP is a utility to find strings within a text - essentially the find function that you use when you use something like CTRL+F.

This is the basic functionality, however - accomplished using the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching. The real cool part of the functionality comes from the fact that we can parse regular expressions.

# What are Regular Expressions?
Regular Expressions are patterns of characters with an intended purpose of culling from text - they specify what we want to look for. For example, if I only want all the spaces between words in a text, then I can enter a regular expression that will give us those spaces.
